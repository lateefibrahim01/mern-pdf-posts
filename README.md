# MERN Stack PDF Sharing App

This is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It allows authenticated users to upload, view, download, and comment on PDF files, along with their title and description. User authentication is exclusively done through Google login. Redux Toolkit is used for state management, and Tailwind CSS is used for styling.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can log in or sign up using their Google accounts.

- **PDF Upload:** Authenticated users can upload PDF files, providing a title and description for each.

- **PDF View:** Authenticated users can view PDF files uploaded by others, along with their titles and descriptions.

- **PDF Download:** Users can download PDF files.

- **Comments:** Authenticated users can leave comments on the uploaded PDF files.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React with Redux Toolkit for state management, styled with Tailwind CSS.

- **Backend:** Node.js with Express for the server, MongoDB for the database.

- **Authentication:** Google OAuth for user authentication.
